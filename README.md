# A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Statistical Significance in Portfolio Management

## Overview
This repository houses a Jupyter Notebook that serves as an educational tool for diving deep into the statistical methodologies employed to assess a portfolio manager's performance. The notebook explores the areas of hypothesis testing, Z-tests, confidence levels, and sample size calculations. It couples textual explanations with mathematical formulas and is further enriched with Python code for hands-on implementation. The ultimate objective is to quantify the number of years a portfolio manager would need to consistently outperform the market to yield a result that is statistically significant with a high degree of confidence.
