# A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Statistical Significance in Portfolio Management

## Overview
This repository houses a Jupyter Notebook designed as an educational tool for understanding the statistical methods involved in evaluating a portfolio manager's performance. The notebook takes a deep dive into hypothesis testing, Z-tests, confidence levels, and sample size calculations. It offers both textual explanations and mathematical formulas, supplemented with Python code for practical implementation. In essence, the notebook aims to quantify the number of years a portfolio manager would need to outperform the market to achieve a statistically significant result with a high level of confidence.
